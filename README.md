## ðŸš€ Why Mason?

Mason is inspired by the elegance of Rails and the flexibility of modern Python frameworks. It promotes:

- **Convention over configuration** â€” skip boilerplate, focus on logic.
- **MVC architecture** â€” stay organized with a familiar structure.
- **First-class CLI & project scaffolding** â€” start projects in seconds.
- **Built-in support for async, background jobs, services, and more.**

## ðŸ§± Project Status

Mason is in early development. Contributions, feedback, and ideas are welcome.
